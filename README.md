# Book Search Engine - GraphQL and MongoDB 18

## Description
A fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API that I refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's set to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
